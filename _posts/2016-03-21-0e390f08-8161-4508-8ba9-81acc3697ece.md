The approval response has been incredible from our "fig-photographers" over the past few weeks. It is really exciting to know that the book will really be a sum of so many parts. Here is just a sneak peek at a few of the photos that we have loved (the folder is growing)!

If you were at the girl & the fig a while ago and want to participate, you can always go back and upload your photo through instagram now and just tag it **\#figchronicles**. If you are visiting us soon, you can do it right on the spot! All of these photographs will that are tagged with stream on the website[www.figchronicles.com][0].

If you would like to sign up for book updates  
(including recipe testing, pre-order pricing, release date, book launch, parties and more ...) **[click here][1]**.

No matter what, we will ask your permission, before using your photograph and of course let you know if we use your picture.
